Encryption plays a critical role in preventing the exposure of sensitive information, such as plaintext credentials, during data transmission. When data is encrypted using protocols like HTTPS (which utilizes SSL/TLS encryption), the data is transformed into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted by the intended recipient. This means that even if an attacker intercepts the data packets during transmission, they would only see scrambled data, not the actual username or password. The encryption process ensures that sensitive information, including login credentials, cannot be easily extracted from intercepted network traffic, greatly enhancing the security of online communication. By enforcing encryption, websites and services protect users from man-in-the-middle attacks and data theft, which are common risks in unencrypted HTTP communications.
