To mitigate ARP spoofing attacks, one effective method is to use static ARP entries. By manually configuring the ARP table with static mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses, attackers are unable to modify the ARP cache with malicious entries. Additionally, enabling Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on switches provides protection by validating ARP packets against a trusted database. Another technique is to implement Virtual LANs (VLANs) to isolate sensitive traffic and reduce the exposure of ARP spoofing. Using VPNs and encrypted communication can also prevent attackers from leveraging ARP spoofing to intercept data. Finally, monitoring network traffic for unusual ARP activity can help detect potential attacks early and trigger countermeasures before significant damage is done.
